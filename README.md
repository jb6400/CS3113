This is a two player game, and the controls are as follows:

WS -- Player 1 Movement

Up/Down Keys -- Player 2 Movement

Space -- To start/restart the game

##Project 3 : Lunar Lander
![Project 2 Demo](demo_gifs/Project_3_demo.gif)

This is a simple single player game, where you, a magical cat, must land on the safe green grass to win! The controls are as follows:

AD -- Player Movement

Space -- To restart the game

##Project 4/5 : Rise of the AI / Platformer

A project made to learn to create AI, turned to platformer, the finished project (Project 5) is a simple 3 level game where you kill all enemies to win! Be careful though, if you touch the ghosts, you're dead. The controls are as follows:

Enter -- To start the game

Arrow Keys -- Player Movement

Space -- Jump/Restart depending on if you died or not

Z -- To shoot

##Final Project : Voidling

Yay, this is the last project for this course! Inspired by the concept of Tamagotchi comes a game where you take care of your own little voidling, but with a twist! You must make sure they're energetic and eat food or else they will hibernate. Make sure they don't get too distracted by the mouse or run from the scary dog. The controls are as follows:

Enter -- To start the game

Click -- Call your voidling wherever you want

F -- To fill up the bowl

Otherwise all the animals live on their own!
